    <!--
      This HTML file serves as the entry point for the game.  It pulls in a
      modern build of Phaser from a public CDN so you don't need to check any
      libraries into version control.  The canvas element is created
      automatically by Phaser when the game is started from game.js.

      To run this game locally, simply open this file in your browser.  To
      publish via GitHub pages or Vercel, ensure this file sits at the root of
      your repository and the assets folder is alongside it as shown in the
      project README.
